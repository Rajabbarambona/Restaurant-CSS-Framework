# Nevada Raj Restaurant Website

This Project has been set up by the use of Html, a bit of CSS and mostly Bootstrap web programming Languages.In fact, I had to consult my coaches and some of my classmates who had already learnt Boostrap to ensure my project has been done properly and in time. I used Bootstrap documentation and exemples, I even went far and searched for videos clips on youtube that would inspire to accomplish my Project.Furthermore, I visited the following websites to get the required pictures whiwh were helpful to the project:

I am glad, I managed to finish my Project in time. I hope I will get experience with time. In fact, the more we continue using a certain language or something, the more, we get used to it. There is a french saying which says that "c'est en forgeant qu'on devient forgeron".
